	<h3>Petar Mrdjen, born 1993, is an Artist.</h3>
</div>
<div>
	<br><p>Petar taught himself filmmaking with a consumer grade DV camera, and a broken microphone he found on the street. Expanding into low res digital photography & cheap film. There was a desire for motion and viscera in his art. An obsession with Noise, handheld Cinematography, & Sculptures with sharp edges. A need for finding the beauty in ugly. All in order to find the natural poetry.</p>
	<br><p>This mindset was amplified when Petar discovered his love for stringed instruments and the electric guitar became the main source of tension at his household. Petar would do his absolute best to play it in every way that it was not designed to. He would also play the piano without ever touching a key. A Piano that after 18 years still hasn't been graced by the presence of a tuning key.</p>
	<br><p>Petar didn't fare well in school, his need to provoke and find loopholes in every exercise naturally meant that his ambitions were met with hesitation. For anyone who knows him this is no surprise, because growing up in the Swedish suburb in a Serbian family came with positives and the unsurprising negatives. This in a town riddled with multiculturalism to the extent that he is met with shocked glares and newspaper headlines upon announcing his homeplace elsewhere. However beautiful and inspiring this meeting point of tradition and language was, one fact cannot be denied. Sweden is culturally deprived.</p>
	<br><p>Once he realised that the 'obscure' & 'underground' band that he loved (Radiohead) was in fact neither of those things Petar started getting claustrophobic. He then decided to escape this place after he couldn't find but one person to discuss a Bergman film with. He needed to find a place where art had meaning in people's lifes. So he found Prague.</p>
	<br><p>test</p>
	<br><p>His latest venture was to teach himself HTML & CSS coding so that he could make this page.</p>
