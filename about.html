					Petar Mrdjen holds a master's degree in Film Sound Design from Stockholm University of the Arts.
					Petar is a collaborative sound designer who has been awarded multiple times for his work in documentary and fiction film. </p>

				<p>
					He studied film, photography, and graphic design in high school — 
					a program which was political in origin rather than artistic. </p>
					
				<p>
					And in 2013, Petar got a diploma in Cinematography and Screenwriting from Prague Film School, Czechia. </p>

				<p>
					Petar's diverse filmmaking background has lent him a deep and intuitive understanding of film dramaturgy and the whole filmmaking process.

					Since the age of 11, Petar has created films with small means,
					equipped then with but a DV camera and a broken upright piano.
					Inspired by the jarring landscape of his hometown of S&ouml;dertälje,
					growing up at the meeting point of the forrested nature and heavy industries. </p>
					
				<p class="box">
					Petar is a self-taught musician, who always was more interested in creating textures than studying scales.
					When he got his first electric-guitar, he spent months learning how to play the feedback tones that it produced.</p>

				"After Prague Film School, I discovered sound design. Sound allowed me to express things with a depth I never could as a director, screenwriter, or cinematographer. 
				I then worked as a freelance sound designer and composer for nine years, also becoming a sound teacher at the school where I studied." </p>

					With his story-focused approach to sound, Petar's ease with conveying sound concepts to directors and producers has made him an integral contributor early in their projects,
					in some cases serving as a co-writer.
					He has built a professional reputation for his flexibility and his ability to make directors feel passionate about sound, as well as a 5.1 project studio from where he works.</p>

					"The first challenge we always have to overcome is language. 
					For instance, how would you describe the qualities of a “warm” sound?  
					I've heard it described in many ways. 
					A photographer drew a parallel to light temperature, 
					describing a candle light as warm, and daylight as cold. 
					I found this odd, because surely the sun must be much warmer than a candle?</p>

				So we must start by talking about sound, 
				finding our unique vocabulary so that we can be collaborators"
