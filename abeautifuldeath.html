	<p class=a>Fiction, Short Film, 11&#8242; Stereo UK.
	<br>Location Sound, Post Production, Original Score, 2018.
	<br>Directed by Will Thomas Freeman, 
	<br>co-produced by Dantalion Films & Period 8 Pictures.

	<br><p>This film explores the topic of Music-thanatology. A tool in aiding a person transition into death. 
	<br><br>"Catherine is a practitioner of &quot;prescriptive music&quot;; she performs the harp for the terminally ill. Whilst observing their vital signs she tailors her playing to suit each client&apos;s personality, state of mind and stage of expiration."
	<br><br>The music and sound design depended heavily on each other. To blur the lines, certains loops, pieces, progressions and scales were chosen ahead of the shoot. On set certain factors were evaluated like colour, temperature, set design, amount of present actors etc. and from that the music was constructed on spot. 
	<br><br>Focus laid primarily on the connection between our Protagonist 'Catherine' and her patients. All music was composed for the Harp and Piano, the latter was completely improvised on set. This is a horror film so it relies heavily on sound design which is mainly based around sounds performed on the Harp.
	<br><br>The challenge here was that we couldn't afford going into the shoot without preparing the music. However what would ultimately be played depended heavily on factors that could only be workshopped on set. The fact that I was present in the whole process means a lot as a composer. It allowed me to come up with a set of rules based on my research into music-thanatology and always be creating.
	<br><br>A shortened version can be experienced in the festical circuit.</p>
